> A brand-new Discord bot for listening into live radio music from your favorite web radio.

## About the bot

*TL;DR - you've never had such a great bot on your server!*

**Tune** is a new upcoming bot which plays live radio music from different web radios of different genres.
The radios are categorized in different genres like *EDM, Jazz, Classics and many more*. 

In next updates, the list of all supported radios will be extended as far as we can. You can also submit your own radio
to this bot (in case *you* are the owner or a authorized person to do that) and we will add it to our list ASAP.

We also support self-hosting. This means, that you can clone or download this repository and add your own radios
to this list in case you want to have more control over the bot.

Disclaimer: We are NOT responsible for any copyright claim or legal issues when you run this bot by your own.

## Install

```sh
npm install
```

## Run tests with *nodemon*

```sh
npm run dev
```
